   <h1>Trevon Diggs makes it clear that his brother, Stefon, should leave Buffalo!</h1>
   <p>There is some MAJOR drama in Buffalo! The Bills offense is a shadow of itself in 2023 from external and internal stressors. Last night, QB Josh Allen and the hometown Bills struggled in a third loss in four weeks.

This time to the often self-destructive Denver Broncos.

But last night's game highlighted a growing concern amongst Buffalo fans.

Josh Allen is a turnover machine who tries to do too much. The frustration of the skill players is boiling over to the point that the offensive coordinator - Ken Dorsey - was fired. Head coach Sean McDermott finds himself firmly on the hot seat with his talented squad now 5-5.</p>
